"""Here we don't care about which state that produce O. Instead we what to know
the probability of the sequence of observations O. We can do this by summing
over all possible paths that produce O. This is the forward algorithm.
Hence why in the slides we first use Sumrule over all emissions given state then take
Product rule over "Emission given State" then sum them all together.
