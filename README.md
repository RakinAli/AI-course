- Decision theory and utility theory
- Diction (NLP)

## Intended Learning Outcomes
After passing the course, the student shall be able to:
- Apply different principles of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Choose appropriate tools and implement efficient solutions to problems in AI
- Integrate tools to design computer programs that show different properties that are expected by an intelligent system
- Present, analyse, and entitle their own solution to an AI problem
- Reflect on and discuss current social and ethical aspects of AI

In order to be able to:
- Draw use of methods of artificial intelligence in analysis, design and implementation of computer programs
- Contribute to the design of an intelligent system in both academic and industrial applications
